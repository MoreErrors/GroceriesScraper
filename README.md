# GroceriesScraper

Companies. Capitalism. Competition. Cgroceries. Cprofit.

I'm making a tool to see:
  - Which product is the cheapest at which supermarket in my local area (there are 4 or 5 of them);
  - And generate grocery list per store.
  - (Decide to go to to marketstands instead because they always seems to be the cheapest);
  
I run the tool with a VPN, just in case.

# As of now
It looks up the price of a zucchini of a single store.
Very vital because I love zucchini's.
